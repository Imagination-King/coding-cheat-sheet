# Welcome to:
# Alex Hamilton's
# Computer Science Cheat Sheet

This project is designed to be a sort of teaching tool / reminder of how various things work in the realm of computer science. It has been designed for personal use by yours truly, but anyone who wants to use it is more than welcome to.

This page is going to act mostly as a table of contents, though I will also include links to external resources that explain things far better than I ever could.

Java Code Snippets Folder
1: Basics
- HelloWorld == gotta start somewhere, might as well be the beginning
- UseArgument == passing arguments to code through CLI
- FunWithVars == Java's 8 primitives
- Comparisons == compare primitives, Strings, and arrays
- LoopityLoops == all the loops
- TestGrades == 2 dimensional arrays

2: Advanced
- FormattingStringsa == printf command
- RegexFinder == sample regular expressions
- Triangle == demo of StdDraw
- ConcertA == demo of StdAudio
- Hate2Love == JOptionPane (pop up text boxes)
- ArrayShuffle == shuffling the content of arrays
- SortArray == demos of both insertion sort (brute force) and merge sort (linearithmic)

3: Beyond Main (Methods, Recursion, Data Types)
- FactorialDemo == example of recursion
- TimeOfDay == an interface and 2 data types, meant to showcase creation of data types and inheritance
- DataStructuresDemo == demos for single linked lists, stacks, and queues
- BSTDemo == demo of a BinarySearchTree

Alexandria (Personal Library)
- FunctionalArrays == demonstration of methods / functions with arrays
- QuickPrompt == library of prompt/get functions for all primitives

Examples from Book
*Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach, by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (2017)*
- Factors == print prime factorization
- PowersOfTwo == lists powers of 2
- PrimeSieve == counting prime factors
- PlayThatTune == plays music samples
- PlayThatTuneDeluxe == adds static methods to embellish sound of original
- Htree == visual representation of recursion
- Luminance == small library to test compatibility of colors
- Turtle == turtle drawing library
- Spiral == draws recursive spirals using Turtle library
- ST and Lookup == Symbol Table and partner Lookup classes

ExternalLibs (External libraries)
I won't list all the included programs, but they have been provided courtesy of the website for the above-mentioned textbook, which can be found here: [Booksite](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11hello/). They are here (mostly) to ensure that the examples from the book work as intended.
