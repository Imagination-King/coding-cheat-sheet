This will be a compilation of various helpful functions from different classes
with some information on usage.

Strings
-print(String s)
  print s
-println()
  prints a new line (could also use "\n")
-println(String s)
  print s then a new line
-printf(String s)
  prints s with some formatting
-int Integer.parseInt(String s)
  converts s to an int
  similar method available for doubles and floats

Scanner class
-Scanner input = new Scanner();
  link an external file for your program to read from
-Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  links the keyboard as the "file" to read from
-input.close()
  closes the link between the program and the external file

Math class
not functions, but the Math class also has some
  helpful constants like Math.E and Math.PI that
  contain their arithmatic values.
-int abs(int a)
  returns absolute value of a
  also works for doubles, longs, and floats
-int max(int a, int b)
  returns larger of the 2 ints
  also works for doubles, longs, and floats
  inverse is int min (int a, int b)
-double sin(double a)
  returns sine of a (in Radians)
  similar functions for cosine (cos), tanget (tan),
  cosecant (asin), secant (acos), and cotanget (atan)
-double toDegrees(double a)
  returns Radian measurement converted to Degrees
  similar function toRadians() goes the other way
-double exp(double a)
  returns e^a
-double log(double a)
  returns natural log of a
-double pow(double a, double b)
  returns a^b
-long round(double a)
  returns a rounded to nearest integer
-double random()
  returns random number x in range 0 <= x < 1
  To get a random number between 2 values:
  Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
-double sqrt(double a)
  returns square root of a
