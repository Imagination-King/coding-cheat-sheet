This will be a compilation of various helpful functions from different classes
with some information on usage.

Arrays
-toString(int[])
  returns String
  quick way to print the contents of an array without loops
  note: 2D arrays need toString called on each row, otherwise
  you'll just get the memory addresses instead of the contents

Strings
-print(String s)
  print s
-println()
  prints a new line (could also use "\n")
-println(String s)
  print s then a new line
-printf(String s)
  prints s with some formatting (see
  FormattingStrings.java for more info)
-replaceFirst(String s, String a)
  regex search for s, replace first instance with a
-Integer.parseInt(String s)
  converts s to an int
  similar method available for doubles and floats

Scanner class
-Scanner input = new Scanner();
  link an external file for your program to read from
-Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  links the keyboard as the "file" to read from
-input.close()
  closes the link between the program and the external file

Math class
  not functions, but the Math class also has some
  helpful constants like Math.E and Math.PI that
  contain their arithmatic values.
-abs(int a)
  returns INT: absolute value of a
  also works for doubles, longs, and floats
-exp(double a)
  returns DOUBLE: e^a
-log(double a)
  returns DOUBLE: natural log of a
-max(int a, int b)
  returns INT: larger of the 2 ints
  also works for doubles, longs, and floats
  inverse is int min (int a, int b)
-pow(double a, double b)
  returns DOUBLE: a^b
-random()
  returns DOUBLE: random number x in range 0 <= x < 1
  To get a random number between 2 values:
  Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
-round(double a)
  returns LONG: a rounded to nearest integer
-sin(double a)
  returns DOUBLE: sine of a (in Radians)
  similar functions for cosine (cos), tanget (tan),
  cosecant (asin), secant (acos), and cotanget (atan)
-sqrt(double a)
  returns DOUBLE: square root of a
-toDegrees(double a)
  returns DOUBLE: Radian measurement converted to Degrees
  similar function toRadians() goes the other way

StdDraw
-setCanvasSize(int w, int h)
-setXscale(double x0, double x1)
  sets x-axis scale to (x0, x1)
  leave args blank to reset to unit square
  setYscale has same functionality
-setPenRadius(double r)
  sets pen radius to r
  leave args empty to reset to .002
-point(double x, double y)
  draws a single point at (x,y)
-line(double x1, double y1, doube x2, double y2)
  draws a line between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
-circle(double x, double y, double r)
  draws a circle centered at (x,y) with radius r
  optionally rename to filledCircle
-square(double x, double y, double r)
  draws a square centered at (x,y) with side length 2r
  optionally rename to filledSquare
-rectangle(double x, double y, double s1, double s2)
  draws a rectangle centered at (x,y) with side lengths 2s1 and 2s2
  optionally rename to filledRectangle
-polygon(double[x], double[y])
  draws a polygon with n sides defined by points defined in the two arrays i.e.
  point 1 ( x[0], y[0] ), point 2 ( x[1], y[1] ), etc.
  optionally rename to filledPolygon
-text(double x, double y, String s)
  prints s originating at point (x,y)
-setFont (Font f)
-setPenColor(Color c)
  Note: Font and Color are special data types, some are defined as constants in StdDraw
-enableDoubleBuffering()
  causes image to be printed in computer memory only,
  meant to help with performance
  use show() to transfer drawing to visible canvas
  use clear(Color c) to fill canvas with color (white if no color is specified)
-pause (double t)
  pauses drawing tasks for t milliseconds

StdAudio
-play(double[] a)
  plays given sound
  instead provide String fileName to play from .wav file
-save(String fileName, double[a])
  save a[] to .wav file
-read(String fileName)
  returns DOUBLE[]: read .wav file back into program
